# research-for-all
A web app designed to provide open access to researcher summaries and feedback on academic papers.

## setup

First, install Django. It's recomended that this be done in a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Once you've activated your virtualenv, run:

`python -m pip install Django`
`pip install mysqlclient`

To start the app, run:

`python manage.py runserver`.
